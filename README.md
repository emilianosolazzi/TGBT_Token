# TGBT — Temporal Gradient Beacon Token

**Token contract (Arbitrum One):** [`0x31228eE520e895DA19f728DE5459b1b317d9b8D8`](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x31228eE520e895DA19f728DE5459b1b317d9b8D8)
**Symbol:** TGBT · **Decimals:** 18 · **Hard cap:** 2,000,000,000 TGBT
**License:** MIT · **Language:** Solidity 100%

This repository contains the on-chain Solidity source for TGBT and its surrounding protocol modules (core, mining, randomness, tokenomics, rate limit, stale-block oracle). The deployed contracts are verified on Arbiscan against the sources in this repo.

TGBT is the native reward and payment asset of the Temporal Gradient protocol:

- reward asset for accepted proof-of-work mining solutions,
- reward asset for validated Bitcoin stale-block proofs,
- payment asset for the proof marketplace and the dead-UTXO certificate registry.

There is **no token sale, no airdrop, no presale, and no public ICO**. All in-circulation TGBT was minted either as an on-chain mining reward or as a governance-recorded initial balance, both verifiable from the transactions referenced below.

## 1. Token Summary

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Token name** | Temporal Gradient Beacon Token |
| **Symbol** | TGBT |
| **Standard** | ERC-20 (immutable, non-upgradeable, non-pausable) |
| **Decimals** | 18 |
| **Hard cap** | 2,000,000,000 TGBT (enforced at the token contract) |
| **Network** | Arbitrum One (chain ID 42161) |
| **Token contract** | `0x31228eE520e895DA19f728DE5459b1b317d9b8D8` (verified on Arbiscan) |
| **Minter** | Single authorized module: `TokenomicsModuleV2` — `0x7B871bdeDdED0064C34e22902181A9a983C9E2ab` (verified on Arbiscan) |
| **Admin mint** | None. No owner-mint, no proxy, no pause. |

The `TGBT` contract enforces the 2B cap at the protocol level. Only the currently-authorized `TokenomicsModuleV2` can call `mint()`, and it is constrained by two immutable budgets encoded in the module:

- **Mining allocation:** 1,900,000,000 TGBT (95% of cap), paid only through accepted commit-reveal mining solutions.
- **Stale-block allocation:** 75,000,000 TGBT (3.75%), paid only through validated Bitcoin stale-block proofs.
- **Unallocated cap headroom:** 25,000,000 TGBT (1.25%) — not assignable to any reward path under the current module set.

Prior tokenomics modules V0 (`0xA9f684d709bB46155A252b260dDDE4cb2a37a0E3`) and V1 (`0xF6069614FE09B91e5B00DA0a13A11B2BFcCabC36`) were explicitly **deauthorized** from minting TGBT; only V2 remains authorized.

## 2. Project Summary (plain, factual, non-promotional)

Temporal Gradient is a proof-of-work randomness and anchoring protocol deployed on Arbitrum One. Independent miners perform CPU-bound work, submit commit-reveal solutions to an on-chain `MiningModule`, and are rewarded in TGBT when their solutions are validated. Accepted solutions feed a verifiable randomness beacon and a batch-epoch Merkle commitment system. The protocol additionally harvests entropy from Bitcoin stale blocks and creates Bitcoin dead-UTXO anchors for provenance records.

TGBT's role is narrow and defined:

1. Reward asset for accepted mining solutions (`MiningModule` → `TokenomicsModuleV2.onBlockMined()`).
2. Reward asset for validated Bitcoin stale-block proofs (`StaleBlockOracle.claimReward()` → `TokenomicsModuleV2.onStaleBlockReward()`).
3. Payment asset for the proof marketplace and the dead-UTXO certificate registry (burn mechanics route miner share back to supply reduction).

There is **no token sale, no airdrop, no presale, and no public ICO**. Every TGBT currently in existence was either (a) minted as a mining reward to miners who did the work on-chain, or (b) seeded through governance-recorded initial balances documented in the deployment record referenced in the appendix.

## 3. Current On-Chain Supply Facts (verifiable)

As of this submission:

| Metric | Source | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `TGBT.totalSupply()` | token contract | ~13,460.375 TGBT |
| `TokenomicsModuleV2.totalMined()` | module | 8,812.5 TGBT (PoW mining + batch epochs) |
| `TokenomicsModuleV2.totalStaleRewards()` | module | 84.0 TGBT (Bitcoin stale-block claims) |
| Other seeded / governance balances | total minus mined minus stale | ~4,563.875 TGBT |
| `TokenomicsModuleV2.isAuthorized()` → true | module | Only V2 can mint |

Note that `totalSupply` is several orders of magnitude below the 2B hard cap. The token is early-stage and the vast majority of the allocation is still unminted and only reachable through verifiable on-chain mining work.

## 4. Governance and Control Disclosure

- **Token owner / admin on `TGBT`:** Ledger hardware wallet `0xd28E6a7AD806E85BD0544ed443D25E48f52c06c3`. Used only for permission management (authorize / revoke minter modules).
- **Protocol operator hot wallet:** `0x5cB4D906f0464b34c44d6555A770BF6aF4A2cEfe`. Used for module registration and live mining operations. Has no direct mint capability.
- **Minting authority:** Restricted to `TokenomicsModuleV2` at `0x7B871bdeDdED0064C34e22902181A9a983C9E2ab`. No EOA can mint TGBT.
- **Upgradability:** The `TGBT` token itself is non-proxy, non-upgradeable, non-pausable. Modules are registered through `TemporalGradientCore`; module permissions are currently unlocked (`permissionsLocked=false`) and are designed to be permanently locked ("Bitcoin-style ossification") once the module set is finalized.

No hidden admin mint function exists in `TGBT`. This is verifiable from the verified source code on Arbiscan.

## 5. Name and Symbol Non-Infringement Statement

To the knowledge of the project operator, **"Temporal Gradient Beacon Token" and the ticker "TGBT" do not infringe any existing trademark, registered mark, or well-known brand**. "TGBT" is derived from the first letters of the full token name and is used specifically within this protocol's context (a randomness and entropy-anchoring beacon on Arbitrum). The project is not associated with, and does not imply any endorsement by, any third-party brand, exchange, financial institution, or foundation.

If Arbiscan identifies a conflict with an existing project or trademark holder, the project is willing to:

- update its public-facing name / symbol representation on Arbiscan's token page, and/or
- attach a clarifying note distinguishing it from any unrelated project with a similar name,
- at Arbiscan's discretion.

## 6. Sender Authority Mitigation

The submission email `emiliano.arlington@gmail.com` is a public-provider address. To demonstrate that this submission is authorized by the actual project operator, the following verification paths are offered:

1. **On-chain signed message** from the protocol operator wallet `0x5cB4D906f0464b34c44d6555A770BF6aF4A2cEfe` or the Ledger governance wallet `0xd28E6a7AD806E85BD0544ed443D25E48f52c06c3`, signing a challenge phrase provided by Arbiscan.
2. **Transaction-based authority proof**: Arbiscan can request a zero-value Arbitrum transaction from either of the two wallets above carrying a predetermined memo (e.g. an Arbiscan-issued token or a calldata note), demonstrating exclusive control.
3. **Verified-contract authorship proof**: contract source for `TGBT`, `TemporalGradientCore`, `TokenomicsModuleV2`, `MiningModule`, `StaleBlockOracle`, and `RateLimitModule` is already **verified on Arbiscan** against the deployer addresses in the appendix.

The project will provide whichever proof Arbiscan prefers.

## 7. Founder / Team Transparency

- **Founder and protocol operator:** Emiliano Solazzi
- **LinkedIn:** will be supplied on Arbiscan's request through the same submission channel (withheld from this on-repo document to avoid publishing personal contact data in a public source tree).
- **Role:** sole maintainer of the public code repository, protocol operator of the live Arbitrum deployment, and the party responsible for this submission.
- **Jurisdiction statement:** the project is a developer-led open-source protocol; it is not a registered investment product, is not marketed as one, and makes no forward-looking financial promises anywhere in its materials.

## 8. Anti-Misrepresentation Declarations

The project attests the following explicitly, to prevent any reviewer concern:

1. **No false claims of partnership.** TGBT is not endorsed by, affiliated with, or partnered with Bitcoin, Arbitrum Foundation, Offchain Labs, Chainlink, OpenZeppelin, or any exchange. The protocol *uses* Bitcoin public data (stale blocks, dead UTXOs) as a verifiable external data source; it does not speak for Bitcoin.
2. **No false claims of security or audit.** TGBT has not undergone a third-party security audit. Source code is public and verified on Arbiscan; reviewers are welcome to inspect it. The project does not use the word "audited" in any user-facing material.
3. **No investment solicitation.** TGBT is described exclusively as a mining reward asset and an in-protocol payment asset. No marketing copy describes it as an investment product, a yield vehicle, or a store of value.
4. **No misrepresentation of technology.** All technical claims in public documentation (whitepaper, README, self-miner dashboard, dashboard UI copy) correspond to behaviour that is actually implemented in the verified on-chain contracts and the open-source runtime. Where a feature is planned or forward-looking (e.g. DAO governance, staking layer), it is explicitly labelled as such.
5. **No misrepresentation of supply.** The current totalSupply is a small fraction of the 2B hard cap. The project does not claim a circulating supply larger than what on-chain reads confirm.
